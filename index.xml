      <description>When is an adjustment needed? The short answer - it&amp;rsquo;s needed when the reel mower is no longer cutting the grass cleanly. That may look different for each lawn depending on the type of grass the person has and how much of an adjustment is needed. I knew that mine needed an adjustment when it was damaging the grass by bending it and leaving brown lines across the blades. You may also see lots of uncut grass blades sticking up throughout your lawn.</description>
