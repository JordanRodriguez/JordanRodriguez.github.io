    <h2 id="when-is-an-adjustment-needed">When is an adjustment needed?</h2>
<p>The short answer - it&rsquo;s needed when the reel mower is no longer cutting the grass cleanly. That may look different for each lawn depending on the type of grass the person has and how much of an adjustment is needed. I knew that mine needed an adjustment when it was damaging the grass by bending it and leaving brown lines across the blades. You may also see lots of uncut grass blades sticking up throughout your lawn.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Place the mower in a location where it&rsquo;s easy for you to work on it and chock the wheels so that it doesn&rsquo;t roll away from you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> You&rsquo;ll now need to check and see how much of an adjustment is needed. Place a piece of paper that&rsquo;s around an inch or so thick between the blades and the cutting bar. Carefully rotate the blades to see if they cut the piece of paper.
It will cut the paper with ease if it&rsquo;s properly adjusted. The paper will bend or have a hard time being cut if it&rsquo;s not properly adjusted. Check the contact between the cutting bar and the blades on the left and right side of the mower since there are two locations to make adjustments. The blades will need to be brought closer to the cutting bar if the paper is not being cut. They&rsquo;ll need to be moved away if it&rsquo;s difficult for the blades to rotate properly.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> You&rsquo;ll now need to adjust the blades closer or further away from the cutting bar based on your results from step 2. Locate the adjusting screws / bolts on your reel mower. Turn the bolt clockwise to bring the blades closer to the cutting bar. Turn the bolt counter clockwise to bring the blades away from the cutting bar.</p>
<p>I have a Fiskars reel mower and the adjustment bolts were located directly in front of the wheels. The location for other reel mowers will vary. Make small adjustments to the bolt and repeat step 2 to check how close the blades are to the cutting bar.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> You&rsquo;re done making adjustments once the piece of paper is easily cut by the blades on both sides of the mower. You don&rsquo;t want there to be too much friction between the blades and the cutting bar. You also don&rsquo;t want there to be too much space between the blade and cutting bar. Congrats!</p>
