    <h2 id="chessboard-and-setup">Chessboard and Setup</h2>
<p><strong>Chessboard</strong>: Chess is played on a square board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The board should be placed so that each player has a white square on their right-hand side.</p>
<p><strong>Chess Pieces</strong>: There are 32 pieces in chess, divided equally between two players. Each player has:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 King</li>
<li>1 Queen</li>
<li>2 Rooks</li>
<li>2 Knights</li>
<li>2 Bishops</li>
<li>8 Pawns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Setup</strong>: Place the pieces on the board as shown below. The back rank should have Rooks in the corners, Knights next to them, followed by Bishops, with the Queen in the remaining square of her color. The King goes next to the Queen.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-pieces-move">How the Pieces Move</h2>
<p>Each chess piece moves differently:</p>
<p><strong>King</strong>: The King moves one square in any direction.</p>
<p><strong>Queen</strong>: The Queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.</p>
<p><strong>Rook</strong>: Rooks move horizontally or vertically any number of squares.</p>
<p><strong>Bishop</strong>: Bishops move diagonally any number of squares.</p>
<p><strong>Knight</strong>: Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that. Knights are the only pieces that can &ldquo;jump&rdquo; over other pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Pawn</strong>: Pawns move forward one square but capture diagonally. On their first move, pawns have the option to move forward two squares.</p>
<p><img src="/learn-how-to-play-chess/chess-piece-movement.jpg" alt="How each chess piece moves"></p>
<h2 id="objective-of-the-game">Objective of the Game</h2>
<p>The objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent&rsquo;s King. &ldquo;Checkmate&rdquo; means the King is in a position to be captured (in check), and there&rsquo;s no legal move for the player to remove the threat.</p>
<h2 id="opening-moves-and-strategies-for-beginners">Opening Moves and Strategies for Beginners</h2>
<h3 id="opening-moves">Opening Moves</h3>
<p><strong>Control the Center</strong>: Try to control the center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) with your pawns and pieces. This gives you more flexibility and mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Develop Your Knights and Bishops</strong>: Knights and Bishops should be developed early in the game. Knights often go to f3/f6 or c3/c6, while Bishops can be fianchettoed (placed behind a pawn) or developed to active squares.</p>
<p>Simple Strategies
Castle Early: Castling is a crucial move for King safety. It involves moving your King two squares toward a Rook and then moving that Rook to the square the King crossed. This helps protect your King and connect your Rooks.</p>
<p>Avoid Moving the Same Piece Multiple Times: In the opening, try to avoid moving the same piece multiple times. Instead, focus on developing all your pieces.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t Neglect Your Pawns: Pawns are the backbone of your defense. Be careful about creating pawn weaknesses and think before moving them.</p>
<p>Remember, chess is a game of strategy and tactics. As you gain more experience, you&rsquo;ll develop a deeper understanding of these basics and explore more advanced strategies.</p>
